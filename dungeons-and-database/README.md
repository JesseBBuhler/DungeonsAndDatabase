# DungeonsAndDatabase
making a site to help me navigate the information in all of my DnD books.  For practice using React and for fun.


I have several different ideas for features but a lot of them are more ambitious than my skill level is currently at.
So I'm going to just make a list of them here and come back to them later after making a landing page and figuring out routing.

1.  A character creator
2.  A moster creator
3.  A digital version of the Dungeon Masters Guide, The Player's Handbook, and The Moster Manual
4.  A place for me to orgainze campaigns.

I am using this tutorial to learn routing.  Come back to this tomorrow.
